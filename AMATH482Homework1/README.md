This report analyzes acoustic measurements from a submarine in the Puget Sound using Fourier anal-
ysis to extract meaningful insights from noisy data. First, we compute the averaged Fourier transform
to determine the submarine’s dominant frequency, verifying our findings through visualizations. Next, we
design and implement a filter to isolate this center frequency, reducing noise and improving the clarity of
the submarine’s trajectory. We then visualize the denoised measurements and assess the eﬀectiveness of
the filtering process. Finally, we extract and plot the submarine’s x,y coordinates over a 24-hour period,
providing valuable insights for future sub-tracking eﬀorts.
