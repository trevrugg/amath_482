This report presents an analysis of the MNIST dataset using various machine learning techniques. We per-
form Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and use Ridge and K-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN) classifiers for classification tasks. The eﬀectiveness of these methods is evaluated and compared. Additionally, we implement an alternative classifier, the Support Vector Machine (SVM), and compare its
performance with the previous classifiers. Results indicate that dimensionality reduction via PCA combined
with appropriate classifiers can eﬀectively classify handwritten digits with high accuracy.
