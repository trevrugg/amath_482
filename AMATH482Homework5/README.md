Portfolio optimization is a fundamental problem in finance, focusing on allocating weights to assets to
maximize returns while minimizing risk. Among several performance metrics, the Sharpe ratio is widely used
for its ability to quantify risk-adjusted returns. This project aimed to utilize an FCN trained on historical
stock data, enhanced with technical indicators, to generate optimal portfolio weights that maximize the
Sharpe ratio on the test set. The study investigates the behavior of the model under diﬀerent hyperparameter
configurations, analyzing their eﬀects on both training stability and test performance.
